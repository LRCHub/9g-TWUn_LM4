[00:08.96] Last night I heard a song, it brought back all these awful feelings
[00:13.45] I never listened long enough, but now I get the meaning
[00:17.63] I was your broken record, soundtrack to your starry ceiling
[00:22.05] Our track was skipping, starting over, is it worth repeating?
[00:52.55] 
[00:26.44] You sang along, and I still lie awake at night
[00:30.80] I can't stop thinkin' 'bout the way you said
[00:52.80] 
[00:33.76] I hope you hear this song over and over again
[00:38.27] I hope it burns a hole right through your fucking head
[00:42.51] And while you're out there dancing to someone new
[00:46.98] I hope you hear this song, I hope it kills you too
[01:11.98] 
[00:51.25] I hope you hate this song (hate this song)
[00:55.91] Like I hate you (like I hate you)
[01:12.41] 
[01:01.03] The ghost of your melody, it haunts me like a fading echo
[01:05.11] You cut through the silence like the sirens through my bedroom window
[01:09.37] I should be movin' on, but you don't want to let me let go
[01:13.89] I've heard this one a million times, and I hope
[01:37.39] 
[01:17.10] That when you hear this song over and over again
[01:21.49] I hope it burns a hole right through your fucking head
[01:25.72] And while you're out there dancing to someone new
[01:30.13] I hope you hear this song, I hope it kills you too
[01:55.13] 
[01:34.58] I hope you hate this song (hate this song)
[01:39.25] Like I hate you (like I hate you)
[01:55.75] 
[01:47.54] When you hear my voice, I hope it makes you sick
[01:51.20] Next time you sing along, you can choke on it
[01:56.89] Yeah, I hope it makes you sick, sick, sick, sick
[02:12.02] Oh, I hope it makes you sick (ha-ha, oh, shit)
[02:35.02] 
[02:16.38] I hope you hear this song over and over again
[02:20.55] I hope it burns a hole right through your fucking head
[02:24.82] And while you're out there dancing to someone new
[02:29.21] I hope you hear this song, I hope it kills you too
[02:54.21] 
[02:33.63] I hope you hate this song (I hope you hate this song)
[02:38.49] Like I hate you (like I hate you)
[02:42.27] I hope you hate this song (I fucking hate this song)
[02:47.05] Like I hate you (like I hate you)
[03:03.55] 
[02:50.74] I hope you hate this song
